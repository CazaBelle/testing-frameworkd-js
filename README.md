# Testing Framework


*This week:*
- You'll work in pairs
- You'll have to create a testing framework for Javascript
- You'll use that framework to test-drive a single page app

*Initial requirements for the testing framework (you should be working on this today):*
- It should show descriptions of the tests
- It should have an equality matcher
- It should tell the user which tests passed or failed

*Backlog or further requirements:*
- The testing Framework should be extracted to its own Github repository with documentation to be reusable.
- It should have a "throws errors" matcher
- It should displays results in red and green
- It should have helpful error messages (why has the test failed / error stack)
- It should have a grouping functionality to organise tests
- It should allow mocking
- It should allow code to be run before each test
- It should have a "respond to" matcher (edited)
